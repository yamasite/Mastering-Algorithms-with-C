The following applies to example files from material published by O’Reilly Media, Inc. Content from other publishers may include different rules of usage. Please refer to any additional usage rights explained in the actual example files or refer to the publisher’s website.
	  
O'Reilly books are here to help you get your job done. In general, you may use the code in O'Reilly books in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you're reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from our books does not require permission. Answering a question by citing our books and quoting example code does not require permission. On the other hand, selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O'Reilly books does require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from our books into your product's documentation does require permission.
	  
We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN.
	  
If you think your use of code examples falls outside fair use or the permission given here, feel free to contact us at <permissions@oreilly.com>.
	  
Please note that the examples are not production code and have not been carefully testing. They are provided "as-is" and come with no warranty of any kind.

It's the stack pointer that points to the actual top of the stack (that is, the point where the next stack frame will be pushed).

For example, data2 cannot share storage with a vertex passed to graph_ins_vertex at some earlier time. For example, to create the graph below, we should do something like the following:  Graph: --------- a -> b b ---------  data2 = (char *)malloc(2); strcpy(data2, "b"); graph_ins_vertex(&graph, data2);  data1 = (char *)malloc(2); strcpy(data1, "a"); graph_ins_vertex(&graph, data1);  data2 = (char *)malloc(2); strcpy(data2, "b"); graph_ins_edge(&graph, data1, data2);  Note that before the call to graph_ins_edge, we allocate new storage for data2. This is because inside of graph_ins_vertex, set_init initializes each new adjacency list with graph->destroy, which will be called once for each vertex in the adjacency list when the graph is destroyed. Since every vertex also appears in the list of AdjList structures, without its own storage each vertex will be destroyed more than once. One solution is to set the destroy parameter of set_init to NULL. However, this alternative poses problems in the form of consistency issues. The important thing to remember, therefore, is simply this: Before any piece of data is inserted into a data structure, it must have *its own* storage allocated for it. (Notice that it is perfectly acceptable in the call to graph_ins_edge, however, not to allocate new storage for data1 because data1 is used only to look up in which adjacency list data2 will be inserted; in other words, the graph does not have a pointer to data1 once the operation completes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Anonymous    |                | Aug 01, 2005   |

The new topic READS AS FOLLOWS:  Numerical Representation in Computers  The representation of numbers in computers is finite. Consequently, computers are limited in the way they can work with certain types of numbers, such as those that are extremely small or large. An understanding of these limitations is important before undertaking most serious work in numerical analysis. This chapter assumes an understanding of these limitations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Anonymous    |                | Aug 01, 2005   |
